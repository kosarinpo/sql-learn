Under the assumption that receipts of money (inc) and payouts (out) can be registered any number of times a day
for each collection point [i.e. the code column is the primary key], display a table with one corresponding row
for each operating date of each collection point.
Result set: point, date, total payout per day (out), total money intake per day (inc).
Missing values are considered to be NULL.
