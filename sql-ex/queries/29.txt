Under the assumption that receipts of money (inc) and payouts (out)
are registered not more than once a day for each collection point
[i.e. the primary key consists of (point, date)], write a query displaying cash
flow data (point, date, income, expense).
Use Income_o and Outcome_o tables.
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN
            Income_o.point is NULL
            THEN
                Outcome_o.point
        ELSE
            Income_o.point
    END AS point
  , CASE
        WHEN
            Income_o.date is NULL
            THEN
                Outcome_o.date
        ELSE
            Income_o.date
    END
  , Income_o.inc
  , Outcome_o.out
FROM
    Income_o
    FULL OUTER JOIN
        Outcome_O
        ON
            (
                Income_o.point = Outcome_o.point
                AND
                Income_o.date = Outcome_o.date
            )
